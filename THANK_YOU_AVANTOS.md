Hello there,

I just wanted to pass a quick note to thank you for making this challenge public. This was a ton of fun for someone like me who is learning software development and seeking a better understanding of how what I'm learning every day might be of value in a large-scale environment.

I had to make a few assumptions (some of which may well be wrong) to implement the functionality, but that was definitely part of the fun.

I especially appreciate that there was a tiny opportunity to use some DSA knowledge and recursion with the DAG bit. 

Thanks again and all the best!
Tony
